                        The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy, physics,
                        philosophy,
                        and
                        metaphysics. The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:

                <p id="theoryP">This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. The
                    Big Bang theory suggests that the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8
                    billion years ago. As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created, leading to
                    the expansion of the cosmos.

                    <p id="blackHoleP">Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions where
                        gravity is so
                        intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and can
                        emit radiation.

                <h2 id="stringTheory">STRING THEORY</h2>
                <p id="stringTheoryP">String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical
                    world. According to
                    this theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain additional
                    microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with
                    different sizes and characteristics.</p>

                <p id="unifiedDescription">Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single
                    framework that explains all fundamental forces and particles in the universe, including gravity,
                    electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.

                <p id="extraDimensions">Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string theory
                    proposes the existence
                    of additional microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially influencing the laws of
                    physics.

                <p id="vibratingStrings">Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental building blocks
                    of matter are not
                    point-like particles but rather one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies,
                    with each vibration corresponding to a different particle type.</p>
